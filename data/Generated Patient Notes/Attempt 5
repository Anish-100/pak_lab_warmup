NIGHT TEACH NOTE

PATIENT: Margaret Oldly
MRN: 88776655
DATE OF ADMISSION: 01/13/3050
ADMITTING INTERN: Theodore Exemplified, MD
LOCATION: EXAMP02
SERVICE: Example C

REASON FOR ADMISSION: Altered mental status, urosepsis.

BRIEF HPI: Please refer to the intern admission note for full details; I agree with those findings and would emphasize the following:

Margaret Oldly is an 88 y.o. female with vascular dementia and chronic foley who presents from "Example Gardens SNF" with AMS and fever. This is a classic presentation for urosepsis in a patient with a chronic indwelling catheter. In the ED she was hypotensive but responded to fluids.

Intern correctly identified the source as urinary (UA 4+ bacteria/WBCs).

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
#Urosepsis:
I agree with the plan to continue Ceftazidime. We should be cautious with fluid resuscitation given her age and history of hypertension, though she responded well initially. The foley must be changed to ensure we are treating the systemic infection and not just a colonized catheter. Given her "Penicillin" allergy is a rash, cephalosporins are generally safe, but we will monitor closely.

#Vascular Dementia / AMS:
Her confusion is likely "sundowning" exacerbated by systemic infection. We should minimize checks overnight if she is stable to allow for better sleep hygiene.

Remainder of plan as per intern admission note.

History of Present Illness: Robert Tracks is a 28 y.o. male with PMH significant for IV drug use who presents with worsening pain, redness, and swelling of his left forearm for 4 days.

MRN: 11223344
DATE OF ADMISSION: 03/16/3051
ADMITTING INTERN: Random Exemplified, MD
LOCATION: EXAMP09A

REASON FOR ADMISSION: Endocarditis/Fever.

BRIEF HPI: 
I agree with the admission note by Dr. Notadoctor. This 31 y/o M is a high-risk patient for MRSA endocarditis given his active IVDU. The new murmur is a significant clinical finding.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
#Endocarditis:
Blood cultures are still pending, but the clinical suspicion is high enough to justify Vanc/Cefepime. We should prioritize the TEE if the TTE is equivocal. I would emphasize monitoring for any new neurologic deficits (embolic stroke) or conduction delays on telemetry.

#Spinal pain:
If the MRI spine shows discitis, we are looking at a minimum of 6 weeks of IV antibiotics. Social work needs to be involved early to discuss the feasibility of home IV antibiotics vs. a skilled nursing facility, as many SNFs will not take patients with active substance use and a PICC line.
