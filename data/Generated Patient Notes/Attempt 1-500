Per SNF report, patient was in her usual state of health until yesterday morning when she became increasingly somnolent and refused meals. Her baseline is alert and oriented to self/place, but she is now only responsive to painful stimuli. SNF noted foul-smelling urine and a temp of 102.1 F. She was started on PO nitrofurantoin 2 days ago for suspected UTI but has not improved. She has a history of ESBL E. coli in 3051 requiring IV carbapenems.

In the ED, she was tachycardic to 110s, BP 98/54. Received 2L NS and was started on IV Meropenem given her history of resistant organisms. No cough, no diarrhea.

UA: Large LE, Nitrite positive, >100 WBC, many bacteria.

Assessment and Plan: 88 y.o. female from SNF with dementia and chronic foley, presenting with sepsis likely 2/2 UTI/Urosepsis.

DATE OF ADMISSION: 12/20/3052
ADMITTING INTERN: Random Exemplified, MD
LOCATION: EXAMP03
SERVICE: Example A

REASON FOR ADMISSION: Hemoptysis and weight loss.

BRIEF HPI: Please refer to the intern admission note for full details; I agree with those findings and would emphasize the following:

Ahmed Al-Safar is a 34 y.o. male, recent immigrant from East Africa (arrived 3 months ago), who presents with 2 weeks of productive cough, intermittent hemoptysis (teaspoon sized), and night sweats. He also reports an unintentional 15-lb weight loss over the last 2 months. 

In the ED, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. CXR showed a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. He has no known history of TB or prior positive PPD. He works as a day laborer in construction.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
#Hemoptysis and cavitary lung lesion:
Highly concerning for pulmonary Tuberculosis given the RUL cavitary lesion, weight loss, night sweats, and recent arrival from an endemic area.
- Patient has been placed in a negative pressure room with airborne precautions.
- Sputum for AFB smear and culture x3 (induced if necessary).
- Sputum GeneXpert ordered.
- Quantiferon Gold sent.
- HIV screen (pending).
- Given stability, holding empiric RIPE therapy until AFB results return but will reassess if he becomes febrile or hemoptysis worsens.

#Nutrition:
- Weight loss is significant. Start high calorie, high protein diet.

Remainder of plan as per intern admission note.
