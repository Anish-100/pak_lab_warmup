**My Approach to Generating a Synthetic Hospital Admission Note**

Okay, so I've been tasked with creating a single synthetic hospital admission note, indistinguishable from a real EHR entry. As a clinical documentation expert, I need this to be as authentic as possible, reflecting the nuances of clinical practice and documentation.

My strategy is to leverage the examples provided, focusing on a structured, detailed approach. I'm choosing the style of "Theodore Exemplified, MD (Internal Medicine PGY-1)" because it offers a good balance of detail and structure, mirroring a typical admission H&P. It will be representative of a standard detailed admission H&P.

The core scenario will involve an elderly female patient from a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) presenting with urosepsis and altered mental status – a very common presentation in urban hospitals. This gives me a solid framework for the note's content.

Here's the plan: I'll start with the patient demographics – an elderly woman named Margaret Sample-Elderly, MRN 98765432, and the date of admission, which I've set as 11/15/3050. This sets the stage for a futuristic, yet realistic, scenario.

I'll then build the note section by section, starting with the Chief Complaint (Altered mental status, fever), followed by a detailed History of Present Illness (HPI) capturing the patient's presentation from the SNF. I will include relevant past medical history (Dementia, HTN, Afib, CKD), medications (including Eliquis for Afib), and allergies. The physical exam will be thorough, noting vital signs like temperature (101.2°F), heart rate (112), and blood pressure (98/60), as well as a focus on key findings such as dry membranes. Labs, of course, will reflect the suspected urosepsis, with a high WBC (18k), a slightly elevated creatinine (1.8), and urinalysis findings like nitrites and leukocyte esterase.

I'll include the "ED Course" section, which I need to remember to populate.

To hit the target length of approximately 500 lines (including spacing), I'll make sure to pad out sections like the Review of Systems (ROS), medication list (including sigs), and the Labs/Results. This reflects how EHR systems often auto-populate large blocks of data.

I'll meticulously structure the note with the standard headers: HPI, ED Course, PMH/PSH, Meds, Allergies, Social/Family Hx, ROS, Physical Exam, Data/Labs, Assessment & Plan, and finally, the Hospital Bundle (diet, DVT prophylaxis, etc.). I'll also add realistic timestamps and pager numbers to enhance the document's authenticity.

The final Assessment & Plan will encompass a problem-based approach, detailing the interventions and monitoring required, such as sepsis protocol, IV fluids, and IV Ceftriaxone. I'll maintain the Intern Note style, as defined, and I'll make sure to flesh out each section to simulate a comprehensive EHR documentation.



Answer:
ADMISSION NOTE

PATIENT: Margaret Elderly-Example
MRN: 88274109
DATE OF ADMISSION: 11/15/3050
TIME: 03:15 AM
ADMITTING ATTENDING: Sarah Realperson, MD
HOSPITAL FLOOR/LOCATION: UNIT04-412
PCP: Robert Primary, MD
CODE STATUS: Full Code 

Chief Complaint/Reason for Admission: Altered mental status, fever

History of Present Illness: 
Margaret Elderly-Example is an 82 y.o. female with a history of vascular dementia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation (on apixaban), and Stage III CKD who was brought to the ED from her Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) for acute change in mental status.

According to the SNF transfer paperwork and a brief phone conversation with the night nurse at the facility, the patient was in her usual state of health (baseline: oriented to person, occasionally place; ambulatory with a walker) until yesterday evening. She reportedly refused her dinner and was noted to be increasingly somnolent. Overnight, she was found to be incontinent of urine—which was noted to be foul-smelling—and had a tactile fever. Her last recorded vitals at the SNF showed a temperature of 101.4 F and a heart rate of 115.

In the ED, the patient was found to be minimally communicative, only moaning to painful stimuli. She was unable to provide a history. No reports of cough, vomiting, or diarrhea from the facility staff. No history of recent falls or head trauma per facility report. 

Regarding recent antibiotic exposure: Patient completed a course of nitrofurantoin 3 months ago for a documented UTI. No other recent hospitalizations in the last 6 months.

ED Course:
Initial Vitals: 38.6 °C (101.5 °F) | HR (!) 118 | BP 96/58 | RR 22 | SpO2 94 % on room air. | Weight 54.5 kg (120 lb)
Meds and Fluids: Received 2L Normal Saline bolus, IV Vancomycin (renal dosed) + Ceftriaxone. 
Labs: WBC 19.2 (88% neutrophils), Cr 1.92 (baseline 1.1-1.2), UA positive for Leukocyte Esterase, Nitrites, and 50-100 WBCs.
Imaging: CXR negative for acute infiltrate. CT Head (non-contrast) showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct.

On arrival to the floor, the patient remains somnolent but is now more reactive to tactile stimulation. She is not yet able to follow commands or answer orientation questions.

Review of Systems: 
Unable to obtain a full 10-point ROS due to patient's mental status.
Constitutional: Positive for fever and somnolence.
Respiratory: No obvious cough or increased work of breathing noted.
Cardiovascular: Tachycardic.
Gastrointestinal: No abdominal distention or obvious tenderness on palpation.
Genitourinary: Foul smelling urine noted in foley bag.
Neurological: Positive for acute encephalopathy/altered mental status.
All other systems: Unable to assess.

Assessment and Plan: 
82 y.o. female from SNF with history of dementia and CKD presenting with fever, tachycardia, and acute encephalopathy. Labs and clinical picture are highly suggestive of Sepsis secondary to Urinary Tract Infection (Urosepsis).

#Sepsis / Urinary Tract Infection
Patient meets SIRS and qSOFA criteria. UA is grossly positive. 
- Source: Likely UTI/Urosepsis.
- Coverage: Patient received Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone in ED. Given PCN allergy (rash), will transition to Aztreonam 1g IV q12h (adjusted for renal function) and discontinue Vanc/Ceftriaxone once stable. 
- Cultures: Awaiting urine and blood culture sensitivities.
- Mentation: Likely metabolic/infectious encephalopathy. Will monitor for improvement as infection clears.

#Acute Kidney Injury on CKD
Cr elevated to 1.92 from baseline 1.2. Likely pre-renal component due to sepsis/dehydration.
- IVF: Continue maintenance IVF with D5 1/2NS at 75cc/hr. Monitor I/Os closely.
- Meds: Hold Lisinopril and Metformin. Avoid nephrotoxins.

#Atrial Fibrillation
Irregularly irregular on exam. 
- Rate control: Continue Metoprolol Succinate 25mg PO Daily; monitor HR/BP.
- Anticoagulation: Continue home Apixaban 2.5mg BID (noted age/weight/Cr for dosing).

#Altered Mental Status (Encephalopathy)
Multifactorial (Infection, AKI, possible dehydration).
- CT Head negative for acute stroke.
- Monitor neuro checks q4h.
- Fall precautions.

#Chronic Medical Issues
- Vascular Dementia: Continue home Memantine and Donepezil.
- Hypertension: Hold Lisinopril for now given borderline BPs and AKI.
- Stage 1 Sacral Decubitus: Barrier cream, frequent repositioning.

Hospital Bundle
Diet: NPO (due to somnolence) - reassess for speech/swallow eval in AM.
DVT Prophylaxis: Continue Apixaban.
Telemetry: Yes, for Afib and tachycardia.
Dispo: Pending resolution of infection and return to baseline mentation.
