NIGHT TEACH NOTE

PATIENT: Samuel Green
MRN: 22334455
DATE OF ADMISSION: 03/20/3053
ADMITTING INTERN: Junior Doctor, MD
LOCATION: WARD08
SERVICE: Medicine B

REASON FOR ADMISSION: Fever and weight loss

BRIEF HPI: Please refer to the intern admission note for full details; I agree with those findings and would emphasize the following:

Samuel Green is a 65 y.o. male with a history of COPD and tobacco use (50 pack-years) who presents with 4 weeks of drenching night sweats, intermittent fevers (Tmax 102F), and an unintentional 15lb weight loss. He also reports a productive cough with occasional blood-streaked sputum. He recently emigrated from Southeast Asia 6 months ago. 

In the ED, he was febrile to 101.8F, stable BP, RR 20. Labs showed a mild leukocytosis (12.5) and a microcytic anemia (Hgb 9.8). CXR revealed a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. He was placed in airborne precautions in the ED. 

His exam was significant for: cachectic appearance, temporal wasting, diminished breath sounds in the RUL with post-tussive rales. No lymphadenopathy appreciated on brief exam.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
#Fever and cavitary lung lesion:
Highly suspicious for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) given the clinical triad of night sweats, weight loss, and RUL cavitary lesion in a recent immigrant. Differential includes necrotizing pneumonia or lung malignancy (squamous cell CA), though infectious etiology is primary concern.

Dx:
- Sputum AFB x3 (at least one early morning sample).
- Quantiferon Gold (though sputum is gold standard).
- HIV screening (indicated for all new TB suspects).
- CT Chest with contrast for better characterization of the lesion.

Tx:
- Maintain strict airborne isolation in a negative pressure room.
- Hold empiric RIPE therapy until AFB results return or high clinical suspicion confirmed by ID.
- Pulmonology and Infectious Disease consults requested.

#Weight loss/Anemia:
Likely constitutional symptoms of primary process.
- Nutrition consult.
- Iron studies/Ferritin to work up anemia of chronic disease vs deficiency.

Lisa Ray is a 45 y.o. female with a history of IV heroin use who presents with 1 week of subjective fevers, malaise, and a painful lesion on her left index finger. She has no significant cardiac history.

In the ED, she was febrile to 102.5F and tachycardic. Labs showed WBC 19.0. An EKG showed sinus tachycardia. Most notably, a new grade III/VI holosystolic murmur was heard at the apex. A bedside ultrasound by the ED provider suggested a vegetation on the mitral valve. She was started on IV Vancomycin and Gentamicin.

His exam was significant for: Ill-appearing female, new holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. Splinter hemorrhages in the nail beds and a tender, raised nodule on the left index finger (Osler node).

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
#Infective Endocarditis:
High clinical suspicion (Duke Criteria: Murmur, IVDU, Fever, Vascular/Immunologic phenomena). Likely MRSA or Streptococcus given history.

Dx:
- Blood cultures x3 (separate sites) - already pending.
- Formal Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) tomorrow; if negative but suspicion remains, will proceed to TEE.
- Baseline EKG to monitor PR interval (rule out perivalvular abscess).

Tx:
- Continue IV Vancomycin (titrate to trough) + Ceftriaxone (synergy/coverage). Gentamicin was held per ID recommendation to avoid nephrotoxicity unless cultures indicate specific need.
- Cardiology and ID consults active.

#Substance Use:
- Monitor for withdrawal (COWS).
