Called his PCP today and was advised to come to the ED for further evaluation.

Pt's VS were:initial tachycardia to 115 that improved with fluids; fever to 101.4 F; tachypnea to 40s with sat >94% on RA
Labs notable for hyperglycemia to 210s; metabolic acidosis with bicarb 16; AGAP elevated 21; hyperkalemia to 5.7.
Normal WBCs, Flu/RSV negative
Imaging w/ CXR showing multifocal PNA

EKG: sinus tachycardia, QTc 417. No concerning ST changes..

ASSESSMENT / PLAN:
40 y/o M with HTN, HLD, IDDM type 2( last A1c 7.4%), CAD s/p DES x3 to LAD in 3048, OSA who presents with four days of fever and one day of cough/SOB with multifocal PNA, r/o COVID-19, hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.

* Multifocal pneumonia
Presenting with fever x4 days and cough/SOB x1 day iso no travel or known sick contacts. Initially septic with fever, tachypnea and tachycardia and elevated lactate to 2.6 - vitals now improved after 2 L IVF.
Diagnosis:
- CXR with multifocal PNA
- Flu/RSV neg
- Infectious Diseases contacted; qualified for COVID - 19 testing as below:

ASSESSMENT: PUI - Patient DOES MEET current criteria for COVID-19 testing
 
PLAN:
- Flu/RSV (pending)
- W/u for multifocal pneumonia
- NP swab for COVID-19 PCR
 
- Recommend that the provider wear an N95 mask + contact + eye protection while obtaining any nasopharyngeal specimens for testing. During this specimen collection, please close the door to the patient's room and wipe down nearby surfaces thereafter.
 
- if PUI and needs admission, continue contact + droplet + eye protection precautions
 
- Exception: if PUI who needs admission and requires nebulizers (if 
there is no suitable alternative inhaler), then needs STRICT ISOLATION (contact + airborne + eye protection) in negative pressure room. Providers should wear N95 mask in room while patient is receiving nebulizers and for 60 minutes afterwards.

- If clinical status deteriorates requiring ICU level of care, please reach out to the Infectious Diseases pager again about testing prioritization.

Treatment:
- CTX and azithromycin for potential CAP - continue CTX for 5 day course and azithro 500 x3 days
- Follow up blood cultures
- Follow up COVID testing; contact Infectious Diseases if decompensation as above
- Supplemental O2 as needed to maintain sat >90%
- Consider chest CT for worsening symptoms
- Consider TTE for worsening symptoms and concern for viral myocarditis/cardiomyopathy - last with normal EF but several years ago

Acute hyperglycemia
BG in 200s in ED with CO2 17 and AGAP of 21 in setting of missed insulin doses x3 days. Concern for DKA vs lactic acidosis (lactate elevated to 2.6). Has received 2 liters IVF but no insulin.
Diagnosis:
- Repeat stat BMP, beta hydroxybuterate, lactate

Treatment:
- If evidence of DKA on repeat labs, start DKA protocol
- If not, will re-start home long acting insulin at lower dose of 15 u BID (total 30 units daily, normal home dose 52 units daily) with SSI
- Hold home oral DM medications and Trulicity IM (given Wednesdays)
- Carb consistent diet

Diabetes mellitus
Last A1c 7.4%. See plan under #Hyperglycemia.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
Per outpatient notes has not tolerated CPAP in past and is not currently receiving nightly CPAP.

Arteriosclerotic heart disease
CAD s/p DES x3 to LAD in 3048. Continued on ASA/Plavix indefinitely. Follows with Example Cardiology.
- No current cardiac symptoms; EKG with sinus tachycardia 
only
- Continue on low risk telemetry; can d/c if normal x24-48 hours
- Continue home ASA, Plavix, Crestor, Zetia, beta blocker with hold parameters
- Will hold ACE-I (lisinopril) 2/2 hyperkalemia; re-start tomorrow if K normalized
