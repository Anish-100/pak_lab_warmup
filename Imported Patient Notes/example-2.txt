He reports that he is overall healthy, and does not take any medications. He first noticed that on 9/4 he had a sore throat and some chest pain (noted to have cough, slight fever to 99.1F, satting 98%) for which he was seen by his PCP. At that time, he was found to be strep negative and treated for costochondritis with ibuprofen + tylenol. He reported he improved afterwards, and then once again started to feel worse. He denies any fever at home (although has been taking OTC meds). He developed a cough, dyspnea, subjective fever that began 6 days ago. No history of asthma or lung disease. Regarding antibiotic exposure recently, he states he last was prescribed antibiotics for tonsillitis more than 1 year ago.


Given the persistence of his symptoms (non-productive cough, worsening dyspnea), he decided to present to the ED. He also reports that he has had some dyspnea with exertion.

DATA/RESULTS

Labs reviewed, and significant for:
BMP: Na 141, K 4.1, Cl 103, CO2 24, Cr 0.73, AG 14, Lactate 0.8
WBC 34 (neutrophilic 90%), Hgb 12.5, Plt 391.
 D-dimer: 1120

Micro:
 3/13: Negative for flu A/B; negative RSV.

Radiology:
 CT Chest Pulmonary Angiogram 09/10/3050
Bilateral patchy and ground glass opacities involving the lower lobes which could reflect any combination of viral pneumonia and/or atelectasis.

 CXR: 09/10/3050
Hazy opacities in the left lower lobe, suggestive of pneumonia.

 EKG:

Normal rate (86), sinus rhythm, slightly delayed R wave progression, no ST-T changes

 Last TTE:
none

Assessment and Plan: 49 y.o. male who works at airport with PMH only significant for recurrent tonsillitis, who presents with cough and dyspnea for 6 days, found to have bilateral patchy and GGOs involving lower lobes concerning for viral pneumonia, undergoing work-up with biofire panel and consideration of COVID19 if other testing negative.

 #Cough, dyspnea
Patient with unclear exposure (works in airport as baggage handler) - high traffic area. Exam and clinical findings suggestive of viral process - no known sick contacts. He does not have any clear consolidation on exam/chest CT to suggest bacterial source. GGOs indicative of likely viral source of respiratory symptoms. In addition, he had an elevated D-dimer (no asymmetric leg swelling, CT-PE negative). Concern for viral vs. Atypical pneumonia given lack of clear consolidation.
Dx:
- Flu neg/RSV neg. Biofire panel pending; if negative, will test for COVID-19.
- 
SpO2: 99-100%
- F/u CRP, procalcitonin
- CXR: largely clear, hazy opacity in LLL
- CT Chest: Bilateral patchy and ground glass opacities involving the lower lobes which
could reflect any combination of viral pneumonia and/or atelectasis
Tx:
- Discontinue IV CTX, if hemodynamically unstable would re-add on broad antibiotics
- Continue azithromycin for anti-inflammatory and potential atypical pneumonia coverage
- Supportive tx: Tylenol, PO hydration
- Continue droplet/contact precautions
- Appreciate Infectious Diseases team guidance
