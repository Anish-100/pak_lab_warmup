NIGHT TEACH NOTE
PATIENT: John Doe Example
MRN: 12345678
DATE OF ADMISSION: 09/10/3050
ADMITTING INTERN: Random Exemplified, MD
LOCATION: EXAMP02
SERVICE: Example C
REASON FOR ADMISSSION: Dyspnea and cough
BRIEF HPI: Please refer to the intern admission note for full details; I agree with those findings and would emphasize the following:?
John Doe Example is a 49 y.o. male with no significant PMH who presents with six days of non-productive cough and dyspnea. His symptoms started on 9/4 with sore throat, low grade fever, and mild chest pain for which he was seen by his PCP, diagnosed with costochondritis and sent home with supportive care. Over the next few days he developed progressive dyspnea with exertion and subjective fevers, which caused him to present to the ED. He has not travelled, but works at the airport as a baggage handler.
In the ED, he was afebrile, normotensive, tachycardic, satting well on room air. Labs were significant for normal BMP, lactate 0.8, WBC 34, D-dimer 1120. He tested negative for flu and RSV. Given his dyspnea and elevated d-dimer, he had a CT PE that showed bilateral patchy opacities and GGOs c/f viral pneumonia. Given his elevated WBC count, he was treated with a 1x dose of IV ceftriaxone.
His exam was significant for: well-appearing man, no dyspnea with speaking in complete sentences, decreased air movement at the bilateral lung bases, no wheezing. Slightly tachycardic, WWP.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
#Cough and dyspnea:
I suspect that Mr. Example's non-productive cough and dyspnea with diffuse GGOs on chest CT are due to a viral pneumonia. Infectious Diseases was contacted and recommended sending Biofire panel, then possibly PCR for SARS-CoV-2 if Biofire is negative. He does have an elevated leukocytosis (34 w/a neutrophil predominance), which raised concern for bacterial pneumonia, for which he received CTX in the ED. Given that he is overall 
well-appearing with no hypoxemia and symptoms/ would favor holding off on additional IV antibiotics for now.
Remainder of plan as per intern admission note.

Chief Complaint/Reason for Admission: cough, dyspnea
History of Present Illness: John Doe Example is a 49 y.o. male with PMH only significant for recurrent tonsiliitis who presents with cough and dyspnea for 6 days.
He reports that he is overall healthy, and does not take any medications. He first noticed that on 9/4 he had a sore throat and some chest pain (noted to have cough, slight fever to 99.1F, satting 98%) for which he was seen by his PCP. At that time, he was found to be strep negative and treated for costochondritis with ibuprofen + tylenol. He reported he improved afterwards, and then once again started to feel worse. He denies any fever at home (although has been taking OTC meds). He developed a cough, dyspnea, subjective fever that began 6 days ago. No history of asthma or lung disease. Regarding antibiotic exposure recently, he states he last was prescribed antibiotics for tonsillitis more than 1 year ago.
Given the persistence of his symptoms (non-productive cough, worsening dyspnea), he decided to present to the ED. He also reports that he has had some dyspnea with exertion.
 Travel/exposure history: He works at the airport as a baggage handler. Has not travelled internationally. He last travelled in mid-August to Fakeplace to Big Beach Resort with a friend (states his friend is doing well).

Meds and 
Fluids: Received 1L, ceftriaxone + azithromycin.
 Flu/RSV negative.

On arrival to the floor, the patient is satting well on room air, not dyspneic with speech. Cites his primary symptoms are cough and fatigue. He denies any other symptoms: diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, headache, dysuria.
 Review of Systems: Pertinent positive and negative as per HPI, otherwise a full review of systems was negative.

DATA/RESULTS
Labs reviewed, and significant for:
BMP: Na 141, K 4.1, Cl 103, CO2 24, Cr 0.73, AG 14, Lactate 0.8
WBC 34 (neutrophilic 90%), Hgb 12.5, Plt 391.
 D-dimer: 1120
Micro:
 3/13: Negative for flu A/B; negative RSV.
Radiology:
 CT Chest Pulmonary Angiogram 09/10/3050
Bilateral patchy and ground glass opacities involving the lower lobes which could reflect any combination of viral pneumonia and/or atelectasis.
 CXR: 09/10/3050
Hazy opacities in the left lower lobe, suggestive of pneumonia.
 EKG:
Normal rate (86), sinus rhythm, slightly delayed R wave progression, no ST-T changes
 Last TTE:
none
Assessment and Plan: 49 y.o. male who works at airport with PMH only significant for recurrent tonsillitis, who presents with cough and dyspnea for 6 days, found to have bilateral patchy and GGOs involving lower lobes concerning for viral pneumonia, undergoing work-up with biofire panel and consideration of COVID19 if other testing negative.
 #Cough, dyspnea
Patient with unclear exposure (works in airport as baggage handler) - high traffic area. Exam and clinical findings suggestive of viral process - no known sick contacts. He does not have any clear consolidation on exam/chest CT to suggest bacterial source. GGOs indicative of likely viral source of respiratory symptoms. In addition, he had an elevated D-dimer (no asymmetric leg swelling, CT-PE negative). Concern for viral vs. Atypical pneumonia given lack of clear consolidation.
Dx:
- Flu neg/RSV neg. Biofire panel pending; if negative, will test for COVID-19.
- 
SpO2: 99-100%
- F/u CRP, procalcitonin
- CXR: largely clear, hazy opacity in LLL
- CT Chest: Bilateral patchy and ground glass opacities involving the lower lobes which
could reflect any combination of viral pneumonia and/or atelectasis
Tx:
- Discontinue IV CTX, if hemodynamically unstable would re-add on broad antibiotics
- Continue azithromycin for anti-inflammatory and potential atypical pneumonia coverage
- Supportive tx: Tylenol, PO hydration
- Continue droplet/contact precautions
- Appreciate Infectious Diseases team guidance
